The session took place at the client’s home. No limitations were in session. Extinction was used to help decrease the client’s attention seeking and escape seeking behaviors of elopement, SIB, hitting, and crying. Blocking was used to help limit client from elopement, dropping to floor, mouthing, pouring out items, throwing items on ground, SIB, climbing, getting out of seat, or from access to highly reinforced items such as toys, trash can, stuffed animals, playdoh, stairs, books, room decorations, and blanket. ABA strategies used in session were prompting, mainly physical, and verbal to help client attend, work on cleaning up, identify letters, colors, and objects, work on interactive and appropriate play, work on sitting, work on sensory play, work on feeding with utilizing fork and spoon, work on utilizing pecs, identify body parts, increase waiting time, and ask for help, more, or all done. The Premack Principle was used to help client complete non preferred activities before preferred activities. NET was used to help teach client while engaging in free play. DTT was ran to help client choose correct choices based on acquired knowledge. Differential reinforcement was used to reinforce correct behavior compared to non appropriate behavior.

Notes:  Supported Chloe today in school with Daveyva. During the session BCBA conducted a preference assessment for client training using a hard copy to identify new reinforcers. Client is expected to engage in many task throughout her day but lacks a  true motivator. However she does have preferences but they are not established as EO’s. BCBA identified 3 reinforcers 1. Slushy’s, 2. Mall and 3. Baking. BCBA and BT will use these to motivate the client to engage in daily task throughout her day. Client has demonstrated independence with a response blocker to reduce mouthing in the form of chewing gum. BCBA will mark this on her graphs to monitor if it’s a strong strategy to reduce mouthing behavior. Chloe displays difficulty with processing language. She tends to repetitively engage in repeating a question to process but doesn’t wait for a response or at times will repeat the response instead of protesting the response. BCBA suggested a latency period for her to process and then respond In the form of a question or to provide her opinion to the SD. BCBA and BT will provide multiple exemplars for the client. Some programming that was worked on today was: communicating before exiting, understanding and processing communicative exchanges using respondent behavior, self monitoring using a schedule, self pacing during tasks and listener training skills using NET targets.

During the session, the client, client’s mom, sibling, nanny, and RBT were present in the home. The client exhibited behaviors consistent with being excited for the BCBA  arrival (e.g., running toward BCBA, and pointing toward BCBA). The client held the BCBAs hand and led him to his room, where intervention sessions take place. Once in the room, the client showed the BCBA and RBT new toys he had in his room. Throughout the session, the client engaged in elopement as a means to get the RBTs attention. The BCBA and RBT placed the behavior in extinction by not giving attention to the client when he eloped. The BCBA, client, and RBT transitioned to the house’s backyard for the second half of the session. While in the backyard, the BCBA and RBT worked on NET goals and PECS. The client’s ability to mand using PECS on phase one is on an increasing trend. In addition to extinction procedures, the RBT and BCBA engaged in antecedent-based strategies to reduce the likelihood of the client engaging in challenging behaviors (e.g., using first/then board). Data were recorded by the BCBA and RBT on skill acquisition and target behaviors via data collection system. Skill acquisition targets worked on: listener responding skills, accepting no (with alternatives), increase amount of time sitting on table, manding using sing language and PECS, intraverbals, eating using fork). Lastly, The BCBA observed the session as a means to determine the extent to which the RBT was implementing the goals as intended. For those goals implemented with integrity, the BCBA provided instructive feedback as well as behavior specific praise.

Blocking was used to help limit client from elopement, dropping to floor, mouthing, pouring out items, throwing items on ground, SIB, climbing, getting out of seat, or from access to highly reinforced items such as toys, trash can, stuffed animals, playdoh, stairs, books, room decorations, and blanket.  ABA strategies used in session were prompting, mainly physical, and verbal to help client attend, work on cleaning up, identify letters, colors, and objects, work on interactive and appropriate play, work on sitting, work on sensory play, work on feeding with utilizing fork and spoon, work on utilizing pecs, identify body parts, increase waiting time, and ask for help, more, or all done. DTT was ran to help client choose correct choices based on acquired knowledge. Differential reinforcement was used to reinforce correct behavior compared to non appropriate behavior. Extinction was used to help decrease the client’s attention seeking and escape seeking behaviors of elopement, SIB, hitting, and crying.

Focused on observing clients social interactions with peers and others, and implementing skill acquisition. Programs targeted during this session were self monitoring program, self pacing, attending to speaker, initiating conversations and conversational exchanges. The client engaged in conversational exchanges with peers independently and was also verbally prompted in some instances with peers and teachers. We also targeted comforting others, inferencing emotions of others and self, making eye contact, responding to compliments appropriately and at appropriate volume, and following two step directions.

Client was observed advocating for herself with peers appropriately when there was interference with her activities. During recess she called out to peers and RBT to ""come here"".  With modeling and verbal prompting from RBT, staff and peers client engaged in reciprocal playing of tag both chasing and being chased. Elopement from assigned line spot was noted after recess but client did respond to staff redirection.  Targets worked on and data collected on: communicating with 3+ words, imitating 6 word phrases, initiating peer conversations and play, eye contact, responding to compliments, simple addition of 2 different stimuli, and recognizing gender and responding to social questions. Caregiver data taken on prompting correct response, having client respond to 1 step directions and responding to function of behavior. Maladaptive behaviors  noted: Echolalia-maintained by automatic-intraverbal prompted to elicit alternative response. Elopement maintained by access- access denied redirected to appropriate area.  Idiosyncratic language maintained by automatic. Question repeated in a different manner and emphasis placed on cue words to elicit appropriate response. During session RBT also utilized screening, verbal and positional prompting to elicit eye contact and response to verbal demands.

After engaging with her in preferred activity she immediately came to table to work when called and performed all tasks requested of her.

Client was observed initiating greetings to several peers as they arrived to class and initiating a conversation with a preferred peer about her new haircut. She was prompted  by RBT and staff to accurately participate in gross motor activity with modeling at circle time. During stations she was supported by RBT to initiate verbal interactions and responding  to peers. She called out to a preferred peer asking her to “come here”.  Client          was non-compliant when she was instructed to clean up materials she was done with before moving on to another activity. During recess she called out to peers and RBT to ""come here"".  Client again engaged in reciprocal playing of tag both chasing and being chased. BCBA supported RBT in helping client to generalize this reciprocal play and other target behaviors of eye contact and intraverbals.  BCBA also provided instruction and support for new targets and Functional communication training and to provide continued prompting for intonations. Elopement from assigned line spot was noted after recess but client did respond to staff redirection.  Targets worked on and data collected on: communicating with 3+ words, initiating peer conversations and play, eye contact, responding to compliments, simple addition of 2 different stimuli, and recognizing gender and responding to social questions. Caregiver data taken on prompting correct response, having client respond to 1 step directions and responding to function of behavior. Maladaptive behaviors  noted: Echolalia-maintained by automatic-intraverbal prompted to elicit alternative response. Elopement maintained by access- access denied redirected to appropriate area.  Idiosyncratic language maintained by automatic. Question repeated in a different manner and emphasis placed on cue words to elicit appropriate response.

Making eye contact and responding to name continue to be behaviors of concern when communicating. We are working on her generalizing her skills across all people well enough that the client seeks out her BT during leisure activities and play times by calling her/his name and initiating play. BCBA suggested prompting her to increase her time and call her peers name when speaking with them with or without eye contact. BCBA model incorporating programs during play with her peers. BCBA will add increasing intonation when speaking with communicative partner across all people. We continue to shape verbal behavior in the home and school environment, along with follow through when demands are placed with or without the use of prompts. Some maladaptive behaviors were presented in school in the form of verbal protest, idiosyncratic language, non compliance and echolalia. RBT collected data during the session on target behaviors and skill acquisition.

BCBA used  IRT and gave him time requested by him for 10 minutes to gather himself before responding to the question. During that latent period, BCBA and BT used Pivotal Response training with his sibling as an MO for client to want to engage. Client yelled twice in the 10 minute break In the form of answering questions and yelling out his mothers name. The maladaptive response lasted 34 minutes. The antecedent of this behavior was prompted by a school event and “not enough” screen time. BCBA suggested and reminded client he needs to complete his afternoon and morning tasks before having  “screen time” and he only has two opportunities. BCBA worked on IRT when walking with people, by walking side by side and With verbal prompts from the BT. Some ABA strategies used today were response blocking, planned ignoring, premack principle, DRA and IRT and latency. Some programming we worked on today were: increasing recall, self monitoring a schedule, waiting for conversational breaks when speaking, and stating excuse.

Once the BCBA arrived at the client's house, the client was engaged in play-based activities with the RBT outdoors. The client smiled when he saw the BCBA, but needed prompting from the RBT to initiate the greeting toward the BCBA. Once the BCBA greeted the client, the client responded independently to the BCBA's initiation. After the greetings, the BCBA, client, and RBT transitioned to the client's room, where sessions take place. The client transitioned without engaging in challenging behaviors. While in the room, the RBT and BCBA worked on the client's skill acquisition goals while engaged in play-based, developmentally appropriate, activities. Skill acquisition goals worked on: independently following 3 step directions, responding to questions independently within 5 seconds, accepting no (with alternatives), increasing flexibility when play schemas are sabotaged, getting others' attention appropriately, motor imitation, increasing adaptive living skills (e.g., washing hands independently), completing toileting routine independently, and waiting for preferred items without engaging in challenging behaviors. The BCBA modeleded to the RBT how to implement new programs added to the client's programs. For example, the BCBA modeled how to implement the waiting program as a means to increase the client's ability to wait for preferred items without engaging in challenging behaviors. The client engaged in verbal protests and aggressive behaviors throughout the session. The BCBA and RBT placed those behaviors in extinction, taking into consideration the function of the behavior. During the session, the RBT, BCBA, client's mom and client's dad were present in the home. Toward the end of the session, the client independently said goodbye to the BCBA and was not engaging in challenging behaviors when the BCBA left the session.

The client engaged in conversational exchanges with peers independently and was also verbally prompted in some instances with peers and teachers. We also talked about keeping appropriate distance between self and others. We discussed initiating a greeting before starting a conversation and walking with a group (and what this looks like). We also targeted comforting others, inferencing emotions of others and self, making eye contact, responding to compliments appropriately, and following two step directions.
