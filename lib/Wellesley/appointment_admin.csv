Behavior Analytic Interventions Used:  Positive Reinforcement,Naturalistic Environment Teaching (NET),Prompting    Notes:  RBT arrived at clients home and RBT, client and clients mom discussed what would happen in session. Client was to watch a tv show that was not preferred, and client would not be able to look at his phone during the episode. Client would have a break of 15 minutes after the episode to do as he pleased. In between both episodes, RBT and client would go for a walk down the street to pick up branches for the fireplace. After the walk, client would watch another episode, then he would have free time for the rest of session. Mom decided that having two comedy shows would be best to start, so the two shows that were selected were B Positive and Neighborhood. Before the first episode of B Positive, client procrastinated for 5 minutes. Client ended up giving RBT his phone and began watching the episode. During the episode, client ate a snack and was attentive throughout the episode. Client was not very responsive when asked questions during the show, but client did laugh at a few of the jokes. After the episode, client immediately grabbed his phone and began looking at eBay throughout the duration of his free time. Client also mentioned that he really wanted to become number 1 for having the best kinetic collection. Afterwards, RBT and client began their walk, where they both collected dry branches. During the walk, client made jokes about the shape of the street and also told RBT about the owl outside of his window during the night, to which client recorded it. After the walk, client began watching an episode of The Neighborhood with RBT. Client gave RBT his phone and was attentive towards the episode. When asked questions about the show, client didn’t seem interested. Client did laugh at a few jokes, but also admitted that he didn’t understand some of the humor. Client also said that he was worried about how in the future, someone might make a joke, and that client doesn’t want to come off as awkward if he doesn’t find it funny. Mom and RBT told client that he can fake laugh/smile and that it’s normal to be in that situation. After the episode client went directly to his phone and began looking on eBay. Client then began playing pinball and tried to beat the top score.

Notes:  Parents and behavior analyst discussed current progress and concerns regarding session.  Discussed client wanting to start sessions a little bit later due to having to come home and have staff already be at his house when he arrives.  We discussed a few different options for sessions.   In addition, we also discussed client's limited interests in other items or activities other than highly preferred activity.  He currently is hyper focused on making sure he does not miss a bid to buy specific items.  He also spends a great deal of time outside of sessions talking with other people around the world that are interested in this specific item/activity (i.e., baby Einstein).  We discussed ways to incorporate expanding his interests and finding a balance between highly preferred item/activity and engaging in other activities.   In addition, discussions and strategies were discussed in regard to increasing activities of daily living skills.  He currently requires verbal prompting to complete activities and requires several verbal prompts to complete each step.  Discussed identifying whether it is a deficit in completing the skill or a need for motivation to complete.  Some of the issue, is that he is on his phone or appears to be thinking about preferred activity and checking if a new item was up to bid on.  Strategies that were discussed is having him complete the activity first and then giving him his phone after it's completed.  We also discussed the location of the visual/list for him to complete.  After a period of time, it appears that the visual is no longer stands out to him as a reminder.  Discussed putting visuals for brushing teeth in the bathroom as opposed to his bedroom door.   Also discussed social skills.  Client has difficulty retaining information after a short period of time.  Repetition of skills is required, and additional support is required.  Social interactions can be difficult as they are changing within each interaction and within each person you are interacting with.  It would be beneficial for client to have a list of questions in which he could remember to ask during social interactions.  This can be worked on during 1:1 sessions with RBT.

Notes:  During today's session, I reviewed with client's father additional objectives and goals that were modified during today's session with RBT and the implementation of these programs by the RBT.  In addition, I discussed the implementation of data collection in home setting verses clinic setting and the importance in separating data collection based on environment.    Also discussed with parent, challenges outside of session which include having him wear a coat, gloves, winter hat etc.  He typically does not like wearing these types of clothing.  He will wear a jacket and then take it off immediately when in the car, however, often times the car is still cold and he will sit while shivering.  We discussed adding these items to sessions to help with desentization of these articles of clothing.  Per parent report, he refuses in the home setting wearing boots, gloves, hat, snow pants.  At school, he has these items there and at times will wear them in the school setting when going outside to recess.   We discussed the parents ability and willingness to have client exposed to a variety of different experiences (i.e., plane rides, skiing, tubing).  There have been times where client has done well, and other times where client has not, but they have given him these experiences to help identify his likes and dislikes.

Recommendations:  Continue with parent training, continue to collect data and implement procedures    Notes:  During today's session, parent and behavior analyst discussed concerns regarding client undressing to go when he has a bowel movement in the home setting.  Behavior analyst asked additional questions to identify if it was just occurring in the home setting or in the school setting as well. Parent will be asking the school team and letting the home team know.  Also discussed strategies with parent to decrease client engaging in this and also discussed the possibility of it now being part of his routine (he has a long history of engaging in this behavior over the years).   In addition, during parent training session, discussed and reviewed current ABC data on scratching outside of sessions. Parent report that he currently engages in this behavior outside of sessions approximately 2 times a week (frequency is low).  Discussed and reviewed his current behaviors during sessions with RBT and implementing procedures in which staff are increasing their proximity from them to him during break time and other times during sessions.  Per parent ABC data, client engages in scratching when attention is diverted from him to someone else or when parent is completing an activity with distance between client and parent.  Client's current behaviors are on a decreasing trend (reviewed and showed data to parents) which would be an ideal time to start to work on more challenging activities for him. In addition, discussed the implementation of this program to include a PECS static board to help increase functional communication (i.e. ""RBT look!"") in replacement of challenging behaviors.    Also discussed the addition of adding sequencing pictures of daily living skills to increase client's independence outside of sessions (i.e., washing hands, folding laundry, washing dishes). Parent reported client did complete washing the dishes one time outside of session since last meeting and he did well.   Client has appointment on 4/22/2022 at 10AM at Boston Children's Hospital for medication consultant, which the BCBA will be attending as well.   Also discussed collecting ABC data on screaming behavior.  At times client will put his hands over his ears and scream while in the community. Parents report this occurs approximately once every 2 weeks.  Behavior analyst to discuss with RBTs to identify if it occurs during their sessions.  This behavior is not currently observed during supervision by the behavior analyst of RBTs.  Additional ABC data collection is warranted.

Behavior Analytic Interventions Used:  Visual Support,Naturalistic Environment Teaching (NET),Prompting    Notes:  Client did not speak, however he loves trucks. He came in was skeptical about everything, however, when he seen the trucks he was happy and began playing. Client likes to be tickled. Client does not like noise, he covers his ears to signify his disliking of it. As well as, when I put my hand in front of the truck he was playing   with, I asked what do you say and he said, “thank you”. I then said “No what do you say and said can you move please.” After, he then repeated it, but I tried again and   continued to just say, “thank you” and I repeated the steps I did prior ,to prompt him to say “Can you move please.” However, this time around, he ignored me. Also, client has tendency to run away or escape and I had to ensure to stay leveled to be able to get up and run as quickly as possible. When he needed help, with the small cars, he did say “I need help” independently. Took him about an hour to move from the corner to the middle of the room. Client is responsive when asking a question, he says yes or no. However, client does mimic, what is being said to him. After an hour, client became more comfortable and was a lot more verbal. Client picked up the Cookie Monster, and identified him, however when it came to putting it back, he through the doll. After times of saying no, after throwing the Cookie Monster and not putting it in the right location, I just put it where it belonged myself. Also, client seemed frazzled, so I asked “what do you need” and he whispered something under his breath, 3 times, I could not make out what was being said. He loves cause and effect toys, he used the dinosaur one and pressed the button, repeatedly. When I put my hand in front of him, he did not like it, he pushed my hand away. I asked, “what do you say”, he ignored it and continued pushing my hand. I did it again and asked, he tried pushing my hand, and still stayed there and I promoted him to say, “move please” and he complied. He likes to toss toys when done. When it was just him in the center by himself, he became more comfortable to move around the mat more to play. At one point, when snow was falling harder, he kept moving closer to the door, however I blocked his way, so he had no access to escape. Became really comfortable by himself, willing to explore more in the center, got him to go to the ball pit(which he liked a lot), sat on a bean bag, and played with the bouncy ball. Staff helped bring a bin to put balls in bin, since they were out the pit and he seemed to like that idea, so bin was left and helped to clean with the bin.  When it came to washing his hands, he did everything independently. Had chicken nuggets, sat at table and independently ate everything, needed no assistance. After finishing all nuggets, he had the choice between Cheetos, Oreos, and cookies, he chose Cheetos. He likes to open Oreos to separate them and eat each half by itself. When he wanted the Cheetos, he gestured for the Cheetos by saying “eat” and pointed. Every time he needed water, I would ask and he said “no”, however when I opened it, he independently drank it and closed the bottle after he was done drinking. Client likes to talk to himself. Client coughs while eating frequently. When in need of water, without me opening it for him, he opened, drank, and closed the bottle independently. Staff took him to the bathroom, client utilized it independently. At 5:19, tried to run out of door.

Behavior Analytic Interventions Used:  Naturalistic Environment Teaching (NET), Prompting, Positive Reinforcement, Self Management, Modeling    Notes:  Client was watching helicopter video on iPad. Client enjoys watching trucks going by. When I put my hand in front of clients toy, I fully promoted him to say “move please.” Client keeps putting his hand in his mouth, I have to repeatedly ask him not to bite his finger. Client was playing with trucks and staff gestured for him to play with a puzzle. Client was not as interested, so continued to play with trucks. Client was interested in magnets, and continued to play with that. He was very responsive   when it came to the staff and playing with the toys provided. Also, he was very   familiarized with the phrase, “move please”, utilized it all when it came to wanting staff to move away. Client was able to read some sight words independently. Client was able to complete a fill in the blank puzzle, with staff. At 2pm, Client was gestured to go eat, at first he ate independently without mom, then began to get aggressive. He started to yell and continuously slam the spoon on the plate. Mom came downstairs to help calm him down, he bit mom hard on the arm and continued to yell. He also bit his hand. Since client did not want to eat, mom went to make a smoothie, however, the noise aggravated even more  him and triggered his aggression to increase. He grabbed the Cheetos bag and threw it on staff. He wanted to grab everything to just throw, so staff had to help him not continue that, he tried to bite part of truck off in his mouth, staff removed truck from his hand. Aggression behavior continued for about 15-20 minutes, dad and mom both had to calm him down. Mom gave him another Cheetos bag, he then continued to eat it independently, by then he was semi calm. His finger still irritated, parents had to take him upstairs to change his bandaid. At 2:45, mom tried to get client to try a smoothie, which he typically enjoys, however he declined. Then staff just allowed him to continue to eat Cheetos and watch his videos on his iPad, until he was calm enough to continue with the session. Client really enjoys Cheetos. Staff prompted for him to go wash his hands, he was compliant. Client did not wash hands independently. At 3:12, mom tried to get client to drink smoothie at the table, client complied and sat at the table. The client wanted a blue cookie, but in order to have the blue cookie, client needed to drink smoothie. Client complied and drank the smoothie, while naming different animals. Client was still calm and no tantrum occurred. Client finished the smoothie. At 3:18, client ate the muffin independently. At 3:28, client told staff bathroom, which he used independently, and that was his first bathroom break since 11. Client barely ate. Mom assisted him in the bathroom. Typically, when client is all done with an item, he needs to be fully promoted to say all done. Client independently sorted out items and put all of them in the right cup. And then pointed  out his favorite color, which is yellow. Client gets distracted easily. Client needs to have a truck in hand, when told to do something, truck is like his safe item. Client did a good job identifying majority of his sight words, barely needed assistance to prompt him to say anything. Client had 19 correct and 12 incorrect.

Putting clothes in hamper, put on underwear, put lotion on body, put on shirt and pants, put on deodorant. Client was then gestured to put his towel back in the bathroom. Following that, client completed the last three steps independently! These steps included: picking up the towel off the floor, closing the glass shower door, and closing the shower curtain. Client also engaged in three instances of starting a conversation. Those instances included: “it’s cold outside”, “tomorrow is Friday”, and “Jackie what are you doing”     ",12,0,Round To Nearest,True,ABA,,2022-05-02T00:00:00,,"CodeMetro, Admin",2022-03-07T23:30:29.49,,Direct Service,,2021-11-02T00:00:00,3.0,180,NAN-RBT,,,wellesley-190,Sagamore,Clinical Staff,jabazinet@abacenters.com,190,RBT,"Bazinet, Jacqueline",wellesley,Full-Time,Hourly,2000-01-01T00:00:00,,,False,"Yudina, Dariya",76,311,N.May - J.Bazinet [97153:180R]  3:00 PM-6:00 PM,2000-01-01T00:00:00,,,,,0.0,Regular Time,15 minutes,,,03/05/2022,2022-05-26

Behavior Analytic Interventions Used:  Modeling,Positive Reinforcement,Visual Support,Naturalistic Environment Teaching (NET),Prompting,Self Management    Notes:  Client was very engaged when staff walked in with his toys. Staff prompted him to the table, at first he was not compliant, but then he became compliant. Client responds well to first then step instructions. Staff told the client first let’s do this, and then you can play with trucks. Client independently said “okay”. Client and staff have been doing 10 minute interval activities, as in complete this activity and then he resumes to playing with his trucks for 10 minutes. The trucks was the positive reinforcement, whenever he was able to complete the 10 minute activity, he was rewarded with truck. When his 10 minute break timed was over, he would bring one of his trucks over and whatever truck he chose to bring with during that interval was the one used as the reinforcement for him to compete whatever activity the staff had for him. However if during the activity, client is not responsive or compliant, time then stops and restarts. Client answered 5 out of 8 emotions correctly. The 3 he got wrong, Staff had to fully prompt him on the right words. During one of his breaks, one of his toys was broken and then he independently said”help.” Then staff prompted him to say “I need help.” After 10 minutes was up, client then went to play with toys, and then asked for wipes, and then staff then fully promoted him, “I need wipes.” Once 10 minutes was up, he came to the table and it was time to write  and staff did a preference assessment on which item he preferred to use. It was between the marker and pencil and client chose the marker. Then when client got the marker he chose to open it with his mouth, and bit it really hard and staff took the marker away. Staff took the top off to show how to open the marker and then reclosed the marker and then  prompted him to open it properly. Then client was instructed to write down his name, and he was able to write down the first name independently and need a partial prompt in order to spell his last name. However after writing down his name several times, client was able to write and pronounce his first and last name independently. Also, client started to bite his finger and staff prompted him to stop biting and he immediately complied. Additionally, client then took his bandaid off his previously infected finger and mom had to take him to dad to put another bandaid on to protect his finger. Then client was brought back by mom, however started to yell “fix” and staff instructed him to “use his words”, however by fix the client wanted to put tape on his truck. Client and staff engaged in math for about 5 minutes, client was independently getting one part of the equation but after 3 questions of staff having to gesture him to ensure he counted the other side, he then independently was able to add both sides of the equations. Client and staff engaged in building a puzzle, client was a little distracted at first, however he was able to make it all the way to the end and was engaging. Client and staff was able to complete a whole puzzle and client was praised by staff. Client was responding to praise positively by smiling a lot. During puzzle, client was intensely scratching his pelvic area. Staff did give client hand sanitizer, however he kept scratching. At 7:30, client went downstairs to eat dinner, where mom fed him. He ate for about 20 minutes. Client came back to session, but very distracted, it was hard to get him back to being focused. As a result, staff gave him 10 more minutes to get the last minute jitters out the way, so he can calm down. Then the time was 8pm and staff laid out the plan for the last 1 hour with him and client independently said “okay.” Staff and client ready a book, however client was not as engaged, yet he still read the book along with staff when asked to do so. Client and staff at 8:30 will brush teeth. Client brushed teeth independently, however he did need staff to gesture to brush tongue. All in all, staff worked a lot of baseline with client and he was fairly consistent with everything he was told to do. Only problem was that he did get distracted fairly easily, however he was compliant. Staff and client read  another book, client was very engaged with that book, staff being able to exclaim and be loud excited the client, which also kept him interested in the book. However when the client was getting to excited he tried to touch the staff’s face. Staff had to keep redirecting him to stop.

RBT will not show client the visual prompt if client states what’s next and completes the step independently.BCBA modeled how to run trials on initiating conversation on having client ask questions about movies. RBT ran programs on folding blanket, reciprocating comments, personal information question,showering, putting lotion and deodorant, brushing teeth, community signs, farewells, requesting for   information, and FCR’s. Client was a little non-compliant with some of his programs but RBT reminded client he would have a longer break if he completed his programs. Client stated he was tired because he didn’t sleep well last night. Client has been initiating conversation with RBT. Client showed RBT that he knows how to move his hips and stated he learned at school. Client was holding a Garfield teddy bear and said, “I have Garfield. I watch Garfield on T.V.” Session ended with client and RBT playing a game of uno.

Client gets easily distracted. Client needed to be partially promoted to identify the colors that were in front of him. Staff had to say “Ye” and client finished with “Yellow.” When timer went off, client knew immediately to tend to the speakers voice. Client needed to be partially prompted to read part of a senescence and client followed through. Client identified 3 out of 8  actions correctly. Client also was able to participate in 1 minute parallel play time   with sister, something that is a target for him to be able to play with not just her but others as well. However when client was not interested anymore, he bolted the room without indication of where he was going. When timer went off for breaks and client needed to return back to session, sometimes staff needed to repeatedly ask him to open the door because he was not being compliant. BCBA was present during this session and modeled how to take rate data for echolalia. Also, BCBA modeled different activities to do, in order to work towards target of client. Client and staff worked on a couple puzzles, he was distracted for all, yet he 2as still able to complete the puzzles. Also, client and staff tried to do a movement break with client by modeling what to do and so he could then follow, yet client was not as compliant or followed directions. Client tried but was not successful in following the directions. BCBA did ask client to “come here” however, client had to be repeatedly asked to “come here.”Client able to independently wash hands. When mom was feeding client, client continuously said,”small” which meant he wanted small portions. Client was able to independently eat without mom. Client barely ate, he consistently licked the spoon, however he did do it independently. “A big muffin” was his positive reinforcement, in order for him to continue to eat. That worked as a positive reinforcement because client was able to eat bigger portions. Client had a bad habit of coloring trucks, instead of on paper and staff had to redirect him multiple times. Without direction, client independently came to brush teeth. Client put too much toothpaste, however, did know where his toothbrush and toothpaste was independently. Staff did fully physically prompt client to help brush his teeth. When it was time to get dressed, client had to be fully physically prompted to put on shirt, however, when it came to putting on his pants and buttoning his shirt, he was able to do that independently.

Notes:  During today's session, BCBA and parents discussed recent implementation of visuals to increase clients independence (i.e., verb/nouns).  In addition, BCBA modeled implementation of visual of ""ok"" ""sure"" for replacement of scratching when denied item/activity.  Discussed with parents having client complete with RBTs then generalize to parents.   In addition, BCBA modeled implementation of ""too loud"" visual as replacement for scratching.  Again, with having client complete with RBTs then with parents.   In addition, parents and behavior analyst discussed current assessment completed and additional objectives based on those assessments (i.e., expressively identifying rooms and objects within those rooms, dirty/clean items).  In addition behavior analyst and parents discussed adding an additional objective to include community outings with RBT to decrease challenging behaviors in the community.  However, given the time of his current sessions, this is challenging.  Decided to incorporate objective in which RBTs and client are going to the park/playground and incorporating social interactions with peers during these opportunities.  Additional objective was also discussed to add to increase social interactions was answering social questions (i.e., what's your favorite food, favorite color?).  Also discussed adding a visual for client to start engaging in reciprocal conversations during sessions.  Visuals consists of a red and green strip.  This visual was shared with parents and the implementation of visual.  Red indicates that client stops and listens green indicates to talk.  Behavior analyst will develop specific strips to start implementing during sessions.   Behavior analyst and parent also discussed client's current school setting.  Parent wants client to participate more throughout his day with the inclusion classroom.  He currently does not due to behaviors, however reports from school has indicated that behaviors at school have decreased and he is doing well.  Parent reported that previously when asked, school team mentioned behaviors were challenging but they were working towards having him integrated for 2 hours a day.

Staff ran a couple wh question trials, client was able to accurately independently identify The who in the picture without any prompting. Client was able to engage in parallel play for 28 minutes. Client shown 3 accounts of property destruction, staff took down abc data to record every instance. Staff did first then directions with client, which he tends to follow well. BCBA did some baseline data with sight ID words, client was able to identify some, but not all. Client and staff tried to do a puzzle, but client was not interested. However earlier when client completing an 8 piece puzzle, he was not as distracted and able to complete with less redirections. The multiple piece puzzles, cause him to be less interested because it requires more, which is something client does not care to engage with. Client able to accurately identify name with no prompt. RBT and BCBA chose to do a more receptive approach to begin with client to start identifying safe and unsafe behaviors. Client is able to understand better and able to move on in more difficultly this way. At 7:30, staff and client went to start new night time routine, where client washes hands then go to eat dinner. After diner, client comes back extremely hyper, takes a second to bring him back, he has no disregard for no programming so “calm body” is always told after dinner because that is when he is the most energized. Client was instructed to go to the table and the client bolted and did not comply, instead he bolted for his toy instead. Staff asked client when is his birthday and client usually needs either a full vocal prompt or even a partial vocal prompt and he was able to independently say, “February 24”. Client is progressing and some prompts he initially needed, is not needed. Also, client struggles with responding to his name, or acknowledging when someone is talking to him, he usually just ignores. When pumping soap, client tends to overpump, so staff had to prompt client. Client was able to complete one button by himself when partially promoted, where to find the hole.

First-Then was used to get client to clean up previous activity before moving onto the next preferred activity.   Used first-then to get client to put on headphones before being able to access the vaccum, client complied but shortly after took the headphones off and after being denied access that instance, client engaged in SIB (biting).

Progress Toward Current Goals:  Parents are progressing towards treatment goals.     Recommendations:  Continue with services, BCBA to modify data collection system to ensure independence scores are being graphed as 100%.     Notes:  During today's session, parents and BCBA discussed client's current progress in skill acquisition programming.  Discussed modifications to programming required to ensure data is accurate.    In addition, behavior analyst and parents discussed client's engaging in challenging behaviors outside of sessions with parents.  Parents report that client is no longer engaging in scratching behaviors outside of sessions.  Previously client was engaging in scratching towards parent an average of 2 instances per week.  Parents report, that client is climbing/jumping on furniture and is requiring multiple prompts to terminate activity.  Discussed during sessions, client will typically engage in behaviors on couches and staff are redirecting him.  During sessions, client engages in low stable rates of challenging behaviors however he typically will get up from the table and need to move his body typically by jumping.  During yesterday's session with RBT while in the community, client engaged in minimal movement of running a jumping which could be due to him being preoccupied with the stimulus environment (i.e. people walking, people playing on the swings).  Parent reported that this morning, client was engaging in running and jumping behaviors and parent engaged him in an incompatible behavior (i.e., washing the dishes).  Discussed engaging him in activities when possible, and the reality of it not always being possible to engage in 1:1 specific activities.  Also adding an independent leisure skill objective to new treatment plan would be beneficial to client and family.

Client was fed half of the meal and then ate meat and bread on his own using his hands (which is how he is usually fed). Client was fed yogurt afterward, and even used the spoon on his own for a few bites. After eating, a schedule was made with most to least preferred activity. After completing, 10 minutes of TV time was used as reinforcer (on timer).   Client was told after TV time, we are going to make another schedule and proceed from there, client complied. Once “staff choice” came up on the schedule, client engaged in a tantrum and non-compliance to staffs choice of activity (coloring). Proceeded to use first-then to get client to agree to coloring, but a couple seconds after him picking up a crayon, grandfather stepped in to check on client, then client started another tantrum including crying and SIB.

BCBA was in the session and ran a few baseline tests and memory games with client. Since one of the targets the client needs to work on responding with yes or no, the memory games, once he finds a “match”, he able to say “yes or no.” Client was able to peer play for about 25 minutes with his sister, which over what is expected, only 10 minutes is required and he did 25 minutes. Client was extremely distracted during session and needed a lot of redirecting to focus more. Also, client was biting his hands a lot causing him to end up with a hangnail. Client and staff was playing with ball, and client usually has a hard time to bounce ball, however BCBA put down a clipboard, to prompt him to bounce and as a result, client was able to bounce it independently. At 7:30, client got ready for his nighttime routine, and was able to independently wash hands. Client usually uses too much soap, when washing hands, however he was able to put an approximate amount and complete the rest of the steps independently. During dinner, client independently used his utensil without mom feeding him and ate completely independently. That item was something he really enjoyed, so he did not need mom to feed him like she usually does. Client did bolt multiple times to get his trucks when asked to come to the table, after breaks. There are sight words, the client needs to work on, like see, he, want, he and we. Client was able to get see and he down, independently but still requires to be full prompted, for the other words. Client does have trouble with echolalia and was continuously repeating during session, so some questions was not easy to know if he knew what was being or said or was just asking another question. When the BCBA was running a program with him, client was scrolling for the right answer, when he was asked the question. Client was able to independently put on shirt and pants. BCBA had to fully physically prompt client while brushing, however he was able to independently turn on water and spit. Client was able to ask independently for help using three word sentences, which is something he usually needed to be prompted for. Client could not complete a task for 5 minutes, without getting distracted. Because client was denied access to bringing more trucks to the table, it resulted in him using aggression to property destruct one of his toy trucks. Staff did take ABC Data.

Notes:  During today's session, parent, home BCBA, school team chair, special education teacher, regular education teacher, school BCBA met to discuss client's current progress in school setting.  Parents are concerned that he is not being integrated into the typical education classroom with peers and requested meeting to discuss further.  School team has expressed that although the notes coming home from school are that client is having a ""great"" day, client is still engaging in aggressions towards peers.  Aggressions towards peers are in the topography of scratching other's faces (peers and adults) and causing harm to others.  Client is quick and unpredictable as to when he will engage in these behaviors.  According to the school data, this month, client has engaged in aggression 2x the month of March.  He is currently integrated during lunch and recess, however during these times, peers are not within close proximity.  In addition, discussions regarding when client has zero rates of behaviors for extended period of time, integration will be developed around appropriate times.  It was discussed during the meeting, client's current skills and understanding of verbal language provides a larger gap between typical peers, than years past.  When programming integration these will be factored in.  The next activity the client will most likely be integrated into will be snack time.    The conversation regarding the client's impulsivity and compulsive to complete specific activities were discussed. This information is helpful in planning client's medical appointment in April.  In addition, conversations regarding transportation was discussed.  Client is currently being transported by his father instead of specialized transportation from the school district.  The school district is currently in negotiation contracts with private bus company to assist in transportation for in-district students to school.

Client needed assistance in the bathroom and staff used full physical prompts. Client and staff tried to do a memory game, but client was too distracted  and needed consistent physical prompts, in order to continue the game. Staff first tried the receptive way of trying to ask which visual was safe vs. unsafe, client continuously chose the unsafe visual as safe. Staff had to full physically prompt him, that was unsafe, instead of safe. When it came to the safety signs, client was able to independently identify what was safe versus unsafe. Client was also able to engage without being distracted as well. Client is also able to state when his birthday is independently. Then staff presented client with a book, bed, and car and first was asked to ”show me…”, then staff used an expressive form as well and Client was able to identify fully what each item was.   Client ignored several instances when staff called his name. Client and staff then worked on sight word ID. Client is able to continuously get the sight words, “we and see”, however, “he, and want”, he needs continuous full vocal prompts. Client and staff was able to read a book for the sight word Id and client got all five words on the cover independently. Mom brought client a smoothie and client enjoyed it all. When client was done, he independently said “all done.” Client engaged in parallel play for about 28 minutes with sister. Within the 28 minutes, client and sister did a puzzle(tried to throw a puzzle piece at her), played ice(no maladaptive behavior) & bounced a ball(too excited, ended up throwing the ice game box). Client and staff had to stay calm body on the floor for about 5 minutes to help client relax, in that 5 minutes we read a book, to help him calm down. Client and staff started on nighttime routine around 7:15pm. Client still needs to be fully promoted for responding with yes or no. Client and staff engaged in some coloring, where client was able to color some signs based on he seen them. Client did not get as distracted as he usually does, coloring allows him to be fully engaged. Also, client was biting himself a lot today. When client was brushing teeth, only able to open water faucet, spit, and get toothbrush independently.

Client's special education teacher appears to have a strong relationship with client and he is able to share things with her that he doesn't typically share with others.  During today's meeting a lot of discussion regarding client's rules that he develops on his own as far as what he can do and what he can't do which really appears to be hindering him.  Once he makes a rule, he does not allow himself to change the rule (i.e., he has a rule that he can't ask someone for help, so now he won't ask anyone for help for anything).  It's unclear where these rules came from and how they developed.  Additional conversations regarding concerns regarding client's mental health and if mental health services would be beneficial to client's overall treatment.  Client's special education teacher mentioned and showed papers in which he gets ""stuck"" in thoughts and is unable to free himself from the thoughts.  Often times he will write the same thing over and over on worksheets/paper.  His special education teacher has been able to have him utilize an app on his phone to write down his feelings and he has used this app to write his feelings down over the course of a weekend.  Now his teacher is trying to have him share these thoughts and feelings with someone that can help him further.    In addition, it was also discussed that client spends a great deal of time up in at night texting to other peers that live all around the world that appear to be having mental health issues.

Discussions regarding client having difficulty due to it being his routine; providing clear expectations for client and consistent follow through for implementation.

He also has another snack at 530 during ABA sessions.  During this snack, parent typically will have client eat foods that he typically doesn't eat.

Eliot struggled to use functional communication when he was attempting to accomplish a difficult task, he was prompted but proceeded to attempt on his own, without requesting help.

He played with a sensory toy. Then he created a schedule with staff. He was reluctant to go outside because he went on a long hike today but when I introduced a bubble gun as a positive reinforcer he was more willing to go outside. The first task on his schedule was a work book of various puzzles and activities. E.R. was non compliant and ABC data was collected. He didn’t want to do the work book and stated that verbally to staff. Then he opened some sensory toys and played with them for a moment. I reminded E.R. of his positive reinforcers and he was willing to get back on task and move forward. E.R. then showed inflexibility with a schedule change. The staff and guardian were trying to find (and eventually found) batteries and a screw driver for the Bubble Gun. As this happened E.R. had a rigid attitude and was growling under his breath at staff. After the batteries were installed, his attitude shifted and he had a better day. E.R. talked with staff for one minute about flying vs super strength using a conversation prompt card. During this conversation he said “he wishes he had super strength so his dad doesn’t think he’s weak.”Then he took a break with the bubble gun. After that he went outside with staff, his younger brother, and his guardian for about 10 minutes. E.R. flossed his teeth with staff. E.R. was very energetic and often found himself off task. After flossing he took a break. During his break he played with his younger brother. They bickered slightly and E.R. said to his brother “don’t do that or I’ll kill you.” Staff and his dad prompted him advising that was inappropriate.  After break E.R. told staff 3 things about his day. He told staff about how he made a cake for the first time for his dad with his babysitter. He also told staff about his hike and about going outside on break and how he feels it went “really good.” While talking about these items, E.R. randomly asked his dad if he cries and why does him and his brother ever see their dad cry? Staff got E.R. back on task and we finished out conversation. Towards the end of the session E.R. had free time to play with sensory toys but instead he wanted to watch 15 minutes of TV before his mom comes for dinner.

He did ball drop for about one and a half minutes. FJ ran around laughing and smiling. He played with the wall alligator and the light up dinosaur. We tried breakfast at the table again and he ate a few bites of bagel and hash browns. Then when the BCBA arrived we tried to have him eat again in a more quiet area but he didn’t want to eat. FJ worked on a matching board, echoics, and putting bears n a cup while he sat at his high chair. FJ ate some yogurt bites and practiced signing for “more.” FJ played on the balance beam, in the ball pit, and watched educational YouTube song videos. The center was very busy today so FJ people watched and laid on the floor. FJ seemed to be more tired today and didn’t want to play as much as usual but this may have been due to the center being busy today. FJ practiced asking for “more” while watching song videos on YouTube with a visual example card. FJ ate lunch and watched Mikey Mouse around 11:15 am. FJ ate about 95% of his PB&J for lunch. During lunch, his PaPa (grandfather) arrived. FJ and I washed his hands and face after lunch. Then we greeted his PaPa. FJ was visibly tired and PaPa and I agreed that he was seemingly feeling over stimulated so PaPa took him for the day to go to the park and unwind before his nap time.

Behavior Analytic Interventions Used:  Antecedent-based interventions,Modeling,Positive Reinforcement,Task Analyses,Visual Support,Prompting,Self Management,Differential Reinforcement    Notes:  ER was watching tv with his younger brother and babysitter when I arrived. He immediately asked for more time but I was early so we compromised for 15 minutes. Then the first task was for ER to make his schedule. When it was time to stop watching TV, he was reluctant to cooperate. But after several reminders, he chose to participate. ER assisted in making his schedule and deciding what order he wants to do things. Today the wind is blowing pretty badly so ER completed some bug worksheets and talked about bugs with staff. We had a very good conversation about friendly bugs and why bugs are important for nature and our eco system. He did mention rare and dangerous bugs but each time one was mentioned, I would discuss a friendly and safe bug of the same type. (Spiders, bees, etc.) ER then worked on a scratch art astronaut and a space maze in his workbook. He tried to stay on task but was distracted by the TV being on in the room next to him multiple times. He did stay busy for that period of time however. ER chose to watch Total Drama Allstars on TV for his break. Then ER and staff played a round of social Jenga which went well with no issues. When it was time for one minute of socialization with staff, ER asked if he could do it without a prompt card. So ER talked to me for a minute straight about water squirt guns vs guns that spray bubbles. Then ER took his second break. ER’s younger brother was upset and disruptive but ER handled himself very well. When it was time to talk about 3 specific things about his day ER was non compliant. ER wondered around the house, bothered his brother, and hid in a cabinet. I tried to suggest positive reinforcers like the bubble gun or TV however he continued to be non compliant. ER then went into his dads room and hid in a laundry basket. Then he laid in his bed under a blanket. After that he moved back into his dads room and played with his dads laundry and clothes hamper. At about 4:30pm his dad got home from work and tried to talk to ER. ER hid in his dads closet. His dad tried to encourage ER to get back on schedule with offering cake after his session as a positive reinforcement. ER told me he rode his bike and then laid on the floor and wouldn’t tell me anything else. ER said multiple times that he is not happy. ER kicked and threw his toy. Then ER told me he rode his bike but he didn’t want to because the babysitter made him. ER told me he had breakfast when he woke up but didn’t want to talk about it. After multiple attempts, he told me he ate Cheerios. He told me he watched TV for his 3rd item and told me about a show called Battle Kitty after multiple attempts. After this, he agreed to floss. He walked over and grabbed the flossed but he did stomp his feet. He flossed two or three upper teeth and then moved on to his lower teeth. He usually flosses for around 3 minutes but he was done in less than one minute today. After he flossed his teeth he said he isn’t doing anything else. He threw his flosser away and watched tv. His dad advised me after the session that he may be tired because they have been with the babysitter since 7 am and spent a large amount of time at Planet Fitness.

He ate toast and bacon with his mom for breakfast. We tried to do stack cups but F.J. was not interested. I gave a visual demonstration of stacking the cups. Then we tried color sorting cups and F.J. did put one blue bear in a blue cup with a gestural prompt. He read his Tiger Book with staff, which is a sensory touch book. We tried photo card s of his mom, dad, and dog. He did say dadda out loud after a verbal prompt. He took a break and snuggled mom. Then he tried the shape sorter toy. F.J. tried threading beads with the BCBA but he was not interested. Staff practiced signing “all done,”, signing “more”, saying “mmm,” saying “bee,” and playing with his maraca. He played with the maraca independently. Today with the matching boards he approached the matching board independently and grabbed it but he didn’t match the color independently. Then staff went to the park with F.J. and his mother. He practiced asking for “more” and saying “all done.” After playing at the park and doing various activities on the playgrounds, we came home. While mom cooked lunch staff modeled the shape sorter for him. He had peanut butter and jelly for lunch. He ate 100% of his lunch. Then F.J. read a book with staff. After that he had a bottle of milk and watched Mikey Mouse as a positive reinforcer. Then he took a nap and our session came to an end. F.J. was in an energetic and positive mood however he did engage in mouthing throughout the session. F.J. did not bite anyone today.

So his grandfather is bringing him a preferred breakfast. FJ bit his mom two times this morning before I arrived. Staff and FJ played with bubbles and practiced asking and signing for “more.” Staff tried to read a book with FJ but he wasn’t interested. Poppa arrived with breakfast, FJ got excited and bit his mom two times. ABC data was collected. FJ then ate eggs for breakfast and he really liked them. FJ is mouthing today and his teeth might be bothering him so he is chewing on a cold teething toy. FJ did put the blue bear in the blue cup with a gestural prompt. We tried to do shapes and colors with the squishy shapes and he did enjoy looking at the shapes and colors. We also tried the color matching board but he was not interested. FJ then watched educational videos on YouTube on his tablet. He was very engaged. He watched the videos with his entire focus and danced to the beat of the songs. FJ and staff practiced signing for “more,” “all done,” saying “mmm,” saying “mama,” saying “dadda,” and using teething toys when he wants to mouth something. FJ was visibly tired and yawned multiple times. FJ was positive today however he did mouth throughout the whole session. FJ did not play with any toy or activity longer than 30 seconds today. He laid on the floor a lot and sucked his thumb. We listened to the Alphabet song and Alphabet Phonics song a few times on his tablet. We tried to play with the ball and threading beads but he wasn’t interested. We listened to more Alphabet videos. We were going to go to the park but at 11 am FJ was visibly tired and did not want to do anything but lay down and suck his thumb. He was sitting in moms lap and bit mom twice while he had a protein shake milk bottle, winded down with Mikey Mouse, and took a nap.  ABC data was collected. FJ was very tired so we ended session early today.

He got settled and did preferred activities before we got started. ER then made his schedule and picked the order of his activities. ER went outside with staff and played with bubbles. Then he played in the dirt with his brother. They were very nice to each other and had a great time. When it was time to come inside ER had to receive several reminders to come inside. But then he came inside and played a game. Today he played a one person drawing game but he had good sportsmanship while playing with his brother outside so I gathered data based on that. Then ER decided to play a game of Go Fish with staff. ER got upset that he was not winning when the timer went off. He said “I hate this” and “I hate everything.” He kicked a box and became non compliant. I gave ER an example of good sportsmanship. I let him know I’d clean up the game and let him cool off. ER took his break. ABC data was collected. After a 10 minute cooldown/break, he got back on schedule. ER then did a word search, a maze, and some bug worksheets. Then ER flossed his teeth with no concerns. ER then took another break. After his break, we talked about 3 specific things about his day. ER struggled with this task and had negative self talk. But was able to complete the task with assistance from staff. ER did tell staff he didn’t go to art class today because he was too embarrassed. ER compromised with staff to do a one minute convo so he could earn his positive reinforcer. (We were previously ending on 3 specific things about his day.) ER talked to staff about his favorite movie. When we completed that task, time was up and the session was over. ER seemed to be tired and his face appeared sleepy. ER received a dinosaur art kit as a positive reinforcer.

The BCBA tried Color Bear Cups again and FJ successfully put the Bear in the cup. Today we used the purple cup. We tried echoics using pictures of his mom and dad. FJ played with with xylophone and imitated the BCBA. FJ was in a positive mood however he did engage in mouthing throughout the session. He had yogurt bites for snack around 9:30 am. At about 10:15 am FJ randomly got upset and started crying. He ran around in circles and cried out loud. So staff set up a comfy spot for FJ, put on Mickey Mouse, and gave him a blanket with a toy. Staff changed his diaper which was wet. He calmed down and watched Mickey while he sucked his thumb. Once Mikey ended he got upset again. Staff tried bubbles, toys, food, and other preferred activities and was still upset. We offered his sandwich and he was not interested. FJ cried and sucked his thumb. He didn’t want to lay down or try to nap. Staff sat with FJ in a quiet area and watched Mikey Mouse. The BCBA texted his grandfather and he came to pick FJ up.

After that he took a break and watched TV. Then he did a puzzle. ER likes to time himself doing things like mazes and puzzles. So he did the puzzle independently and timed himself. Then ER watched a video on YouTube about “What is plaque on your teeth?” Then ER played Crazy 8s with staff and he did really good. He lost the first two rounds and won the third round. He had great sportsmanship and did not have any negative behaviors or frustrated feelings. He even gave staff a “secret handshake” which consisted of multiple high-fives and fist bumps. Then ER took a break and watched TV as a positive reinforcer. Lastly ER talked to staff for one minute using a prompt card. We talked about if we prefer homework vs reading. He was reluctant to stop watching TV and participate but after a few reminders, ER stayed on task. At the end of session, we talked about how session went today and we both agreed that ER had an awesome, amazing, and top notch day today. Then session came to an end and ER winded down with some TV.

He didn’t know what to use for cleaner but with my  assistance he found Clorox wipes. He was able to perform the other steps independently however. He did ask me if I could hold the items from the sink while he cleaned under them, but I encouraged him to do it independently. Then he reluctantly had a one minute convo with staff. We used a prompt card but it was a card he picks often which is “what is your favorite movie?” Then he took a break and played with bubbles as a positive reinforcer. After that he told me 3 Specific Things About His Day. He told me he went to Art for part of the class today. After that he flossed. Today is the first time he did not need his flossing steps visual aid. He completed all of the flossing steps independently. Today it is rainy and cold so we could not go outside. Next ER did 3 Mazes and timed himself. After that he took a break. After his break he read a book for 10 minutes and stayed focused the entire time. At the end of the session, we talked about how our day/session went together. We both agreed that today was a great day and he was very focused and successful.

Notes:  During today's session, Parent and BCBA discussed the implementation of transitioning client from eating at the couch to at the table in the kitchen.  The RBTs will start by having client slowly start to have him go into the kitchen to get an item or put an item on the kitchen table.  Then RBTs will increase time in the kitchen in slow increments; clients will then transition to reading a book at the table in the kitchen.  The overall goal is to have client sitting at the table while reading a book while eating dinner.

Behavior Analytic Interventions Used:  Antecedent-based interventions,Positive Reinforcement,Task Analyses,Naturalistic Environment Teaching (NET),Prompting,Self Management,Functional Communication Training (FCT),Differential Reinforcement    Notes:  When I arrived ER was walking home from school with his babysitter and younger brother. He settled in with a 5 minute TV break and we got started. ER made his schedule and picked the order. ER doesn’t like writing the words of the tasks so he instead drew a picture of each task. First he swept his dads room. He was able to get the broom out without any assistance. He didn’t sweep the whole room properly but he tried. Staff had to remind him to pick up clothes and sweep underneath them. Then he dumped the dust pan without assistance. While sweeping his dad arrived. Then ER cleaned the kitchen sink. He didn’t have any available cleaning products so we used a wet paper towel. Next we went outside. It’s very nice outside and he played with bubbles. When we first got outside, ER froze up and was reluctant to continue. But with some encouragement, he was fine and had fun with the bubbles. After being outside for 10 minutes, ER took a 8 minute TV break with his dad and younger brother. Then ER did a maze and timed himself. He only wanted to do one maze. He kept getting distracted by the TV being on in the living room. Then ER flossed his teeth. He did not need the visual aid today and successfully completed all the steps. After that ER played Go Fish with staff. He did lose and we did talk about good sportsmanship because he said “ohhhhh” in an upset tone when he lost. He also growled a few times during the round when I would successfully guess a card. But he did not act out other than that. Then he shook my hand, made eye contact, and said good game. Then he took a break and watched 8 minutes of TV. After that he became non compliant when it was time to continue his schedule because he wants to watch TV. I had to encourage him multiple times to tell me 3 Specific Things about his day. After some non compliance and reminders to stay on schedule, ER got back on task. After 3 Specific Things, we had a one minute conversation about “Our Favorite Superhero.” Then we wrapped up session talking about how our meeting/session went. Overall we agreed he had a good day but he could have had a better day. He did turn it around however and completed his schedule therefore earning a positive reinforcer which was a Harry Potter mystery keychain.

After game client manded for his grandfathers phone 3-4 times, when denied access, client kindly walked away and proceeded to use “fun and games” book. Client was given 2 minutes of grandmothers cellphone, when timer was done client was redirected back to reading a book. For dinner client was able to eat finger foods (egg and bread) independently. Reinforcers were candy, choice of book, iPad, and coloring.

As reviewing current progress with previous objectives, parent expressed concern and was upset as she has stated that client has previously been able to demonstrate these objectives with her.  BCBA explained generalizing skills have been difficult for client.  BCBA also trained parent the analyzing of graphs and the targets client did master.  Parent preferred to discuss new objectives instead.  BCBA reviewed proposed objectives during the upcoming treatment plan.  Parent agreed with the current new objectives and was pleased.   BCBA and parent also discussed introducing another BCBA out of Worcester.  BCBA will update parent as transition occurs.

ER was energetic but he did not stay on task throughout the day. ER had multiple instances of non compliance. ER did not use kind words with his grandmother and his brother. ER threw some magnet toys and did not want to follow directions. ER spent most of his session playing with magnet toys and ignoring staff. Staff tried to redirect him and then gave him space. ER did agree to play a game with staff around 4:15pm. ER picked a 3 person game called Spoons and invited his brother to play with us. We played two rounds with no issues and then session was over.

Session Location:  Home    Current Clinical Status:  This client benefits from ABA Therapy. ER was visibly upset when he got home from school. The BT attempted to socialize with him about his day and he advised that he didn’t want to talk about it. The client cried physical tears multiple times. The client was not engaged with me, he did not respond to BT prompts, and we had a lot of difficulties transitioning between tasks.  The client displayed instances of frustration and non compliance. We did not have a productive day today.    Behavior Analytic Interventions Used:  Antecedent-based interventions, Positive Reinforcement, Task Analyses, Visual Support, Naturalistic Environment Teaching (NET), Prompting, Self Management, Functional Communication Training (FCT), Differential Reinforcement, Modeling    Notes:  The BT met with ER in his residence.     During the session, BT implemented the following adaptive behavior treatments by protocol as described in the treatment plan- functional communication training, functional play with objects/toys, ABI, Modeling, Positive and Differential Reinforcement, TA, Prompting, and Self Management.      Progress towards the goal was observed with the following programs: Recall (3 Things About His Day) and Reciprocal Conversation     There continues to be a need to improve the following areas: increasing patience, following directions, decreasing physical aggression/property damage, and decreasing non compliance. The client was very non compliant today.      In addition, data was collected and recorded on Catalyst for programs- 3 Specific Things About His Day, Reciprocal Conversation, and Tolerates a Schedule Change     The client’s response to treatment was: negative and disengaged. ER was lethargic and sad, therefore he did not stay on task throughout the day. The BIP was utilized per the BCBA’s instructions. ER had multiple instances of non compliance and broke down into tears because he had a bad day at school multiple times. ER did not use kind words with the BT. ER slammed the front door and did not want to follow directions. ER spent most of his session on the couch, under a blanket, ignoring staff and occasionally growling at staff and his family members. Staff tried to redirect him and then gave him space. The client asked the BT to assemble a craft plane independently so the BT observed the client during Naturalistic Play and encouraged the client to handle his emotions in a mature and respectful way. ER then broke the plane and got upset again. After some time the client agreed to draw/color and listen to music for therapeutic purposes however he independently expressed he doesn’t want to talk. So staff observed more Naturalistic Play and encouraged handling his emotions in a calm and mature way. The client engaged with me 20% of the times I tried to interact with him. Around 4:30 ER agreed to have a one minute conversation for his Reciprocal Conversation goal. The remainder of the session was spent encouraging healthy communication, kind words, and respectful actions. ER was not crying when session ended and appears to be more calm then before session.
